Tax money is wasted, talent is taken, and resources are drained from talented artists who could tell better stories! Disney clearly doesn't care about us fans.  All this wastefulness would make the Disney founder ashamed."

But I, and I believe most other men, and even women are tired of this. I’m sick of seeing these movies that are clearly set up to break the gender role and make it blatantly obvious with the message they are trying to get across. I truly believe Disney and other film companies will never understand that them doing these types of films actually undermines the concept of gender equality because they’re making it as if this PARTICULAR film is the exception and not the status quo. It’s how they butchered She-Hulk and so many other female superhero characters. It’s really offensive to women in general when you think about it. I don’t wanna see *”Strong Female Characters.”* I wanna see *”Strong Characters who happen to be Female.”*"

AND if somebody hates on MORE females:

Male Prota: 5, 6, 5, 11, 2 =29
Female Prota: 1, 0, 1, 4, 2 =8
Team-Ups: 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, =7

I counted the major MCU projects seperated by comma for phases since 2008 until now, so even with the Marvels and Echo coming up we just had 8(!) female lead projects in comparison to 29 male lead projects.

Those people who hate should stop the M-She-U or woke talk. 👋"

She was a true die hard mcu & comic book fan way before she got the role! She knows probably 80% of the source material from the comics. No one within the entire mcu roster knows as much marvel history than maybe except Feigi but thats it. For most actors, appearing in the mcu is just another role or job. For someone like Iman its every teenage fanboy/girls dream come true. Marvel nailed the casting with her! Such a 1:1 pick the role of Kamala Khan. You could argue Marvel created the character based off of Iman."

I preordered my tickets and everything and was hoping to like it.), even though I thought Captain Marvel's character in Endgame was pretty good. For some reason she was like a board of wood in her stand-alone movie, not sure why. I loved the Maria Rambeau character in that movie though, she was really good. But it looks like Brie Larson has learned from her mistakes because she seems to be a lot looser and likeable already just from the bits in this trailer, so definitely looking forward to seeing this and hoping it redeems Brie Larson's Captain Marvel..."

The scene where Fury is looking at Kamala is taking place simultaneously with the scene of captain marvel from Ms marvel season finale. Well Ms Marvel is a year before Secret Invasion.

It was so bad we had to turn it off. Such a waste of time for Captain Marvel. She was great in the Avengers but clownish in this movie.

1363,Lovegood Cleo,2023-05-29T09:41:45Z,2023-05-29T09:41:45Z,4,"You know, I just watched the trailer for ""The Marvels"" which is a sequel to the movie ""Captain Marvel"".  and the funny fact that I read from the news is that the release of The Marvel film was delayed which should have been released earlier, postponed to November 5 and that was because the main character who played Captain Marvel, namely Brie Laraon, did not agree with the title of the continuation of the initial film, namely Captain Marvel  .  Personally, I agree with Brie Larson, the title for the sequel to Captain Marvel should also be ""Captain Marvel"", not ""The Marvels"".  let's look at previous Marvel films such as Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Spiderman, and so on, their advanced film titles always start with the same word, while The Marvels which is said to be the sequel of Captain Mavel, seems to have no  relatability or this is more like a new story.  if indeed this film is a sequel to Captain Marvel, why doesn't the MCU make it ""Captai Marvel, The Marvels"" as the title of this sequel, like ""Captai America, the First Avanger"" as the first film and ""Captain America, The Winter Soldier""  "", and ""Captain America, Civil War"" as the second and third films.  and what if there is a third film from Captain Marvel, what will the title of the film be like?, will it be different like this second film or the MCU decides to change the title of the film because it's still not too late"

For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord. And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger. And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.   (Luke 2:10-14)
-Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: (but) he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also.   (1 John 2:23)
-And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation; And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.

I’m a female, black, and liberal, but even I’m sick of all the pandering and social activism that goes on in the last few movies.. What happened to all the  men? And what’s up with the screaming?? I really thought that my phone got hacked when I first heard it at the start of the video. OMG, OMG, OMG…. And why does Disney continue to insist on turning all these movies into some comedic plot?? Before Disney, each character had its own funny line, bragged a little, or did something cool or stupid, but now it’s over the top. It’s no longer a super hero movie that happens to be funny. This is a comedy that happens to have superhero’s in it. Also, usually,  trailers are the compilation of some of the best scenes in the movies, at least enough to peep your interest. Is this the best Disney has??? Nick Fury is the only legit acting in this movie. However, this is not enough to convince me to watch it so I don’t intend to see it."

This film's camera work, color grading, tone, fight choreography (from the small bit we see), and chemistry between the three leads is a significant improvement over the first film and a huge step up from stuff like Quantumania. The delay from July to November is doing wonders for this movie, and it feels like it'll be a fun time. I usually expect cape flicks by horror directors to be pretty good, and this isn't disappointing so far. Brie's performance and emotional range are also improved from the first, maybe because they actually got a director who knows how capable she is as an actress (see Scott Pilgrim). Some of y'all really look at things at surface level, and this comment section is proof."

In all seriousness, you know like in TLM, Peter Pan and other trailers that have women, LGBTQ+ and POC in the stoplight, there’s people who can’t comprehend the idea of them being in media and use sarcasm and buzzwords like woke to hide their mask off hate and bigotry. These are the kind of delusional manlets who watch toxic reactionaries such as Nerdrotic (originator of the stupid phrase M’She’U), HeelsvsBabyface, Critical Drinker, TalkTV, Ben Shapiro, Ryan Kinnel. The minority of people who She-Hulk was trying to mock and expose."

But honestly I think the only issue with this movie is that the first Captain Marvel movie wasn't as good. In CM, she wasn't given any character and the story was told poorly. Monica Rambo and Kamala Khan had more character development."

2592,Ezra Farrant,2023-05-02T12:20:01Z,2023-05-02T12:20:01Z,2,Looks like it'll be a really shitty version of freaky Friday with yet another gender swapped character (Dar-Benn is the lass holding Rowan the accusers staff at the end and is supposed to be a guy not a girl) Can we please just let the MCU die now? Hasn't it and its fans have suffered enough?
2593,Ayesha,2023-05-02T12:08:24Z,2023-05-02T12:08:36Z,0,"@JK The whole market fell 25%; Disney is a parks/cruises/resorts company first; a pandemic would hit such companies hardest; and a fear of a looming recession delay its rebound. Otherwise all the metrics are published; parks posting record profits, winning the box office 8 years in a row and streaming overtook Netflix in record time. 

   Warner Brothers, Amazon, Paramount, Comcast, Meta, and Netflix all lost more stock value and fired more people than Disney. Does that mean Netflix's Stranger Things and HBO's House of Dragon and Last of Us are all flops? if they are successful, why do the numbers not bear them out? Tesla lost half a trillion dollars and fired more people does that mean Tesla cars are all crap, if not then why don't the number bear it out?

  Marvel and SW? I'll simplify it as follows; Disney bought both for 4 billion each and they are now worth 60 and 70 billion respectively."

There's a reason they play Intergalactic in this trailer.

I get that the Marvel movies were super popular in those first years but I am just not into superhero movies. Find them quite boring and predictable and they constantly got shoved in your face all the time and if you didn't care for them you'd get attacked by rabid fans of them. I'd say Batman trilogy from Chris Nolan (which was not Marvel) was the only exception which made the superhero genre gritty. dark, and realistic. Its pretty great seeing Marvel sales drop and dislikes on the trailers now because I never cared about these movies or characters to begin with. So why type this? Basically hope it means the popularity is finally dying off and we can get more original movies created that are not about superheros instead of this cookie cutter crap."

With this trailer.. am I suppose to belive that women dont  need man? That women all alone can defeat evil?
I'm so sick about that agenda. Whomever told you women don't need man clearly lied to you, We both nead each other! That's why I enjoyed watching Captain America The winter soldier (Nat working with Steve), Tony surviving in a spaceshift with Nebula, ant-man working with the wasp, and so many like that. Even Captain Marvel working with Nick Fury was nice. I'm so tired of this Woke agenda ruining every movie. I'm also a women and even I get so sick of this 😩"

Now …….. what has gone wrong? First Ms Marvel was crap, then the overpower a female character while making a male God (Thor) into a fat flop in Endgame but still worked, i give them that.
Unfortunately Chadwick died after Black Panther and the follow up was good at start, Namor being presented as too powerful bringing wakanda to it’s knees, and then Shuri becomes overpowered while Namor becomes a weakling in the end to bend the knee to a girl 😡😡😡😡😡

3336,James Johnson,2023-04-25T16:06:58Z,2023-04-25T16:06:58Z,3,People are so quick to hate on marvel films which focus on women in the lead roles… it’s actually kinda sad. Captain Marvel wasn’t bad at all and Brie Larson was the perfect fit but people are so quick to hate on the premise that it’s supporting feminism and men are no longer in the lead but instead you have women who are amazingly powerful and have taken over the spotlight of the men who are no longer in the MCU. Same thing happened with She-Hulk which wasn’t bad either it just gets a bad wrap because she’s taking over the role of Hulk and little fanboys can’t accept that.
3337,Ankit Sharma,2023-04-25T15:51:08Z,2023-04-25T15:51:08Z,2,"Congratulations to marvel for finally perfecting their unmatched skill of putting unnecessary, immoving and repetitive humour in their projects which takes away from plot and characters.

Character development for Carol should be a nice touch, Teyonah is super cool, and Iman is a delight to watch on screen. This might actually be hilarious. Marvel has always been more tongue-in-cheek and provided more intentional comic relief than other superhero franchises could dream of."

O erro foi o roteiro, os efeitos, e usar da industria do filme para ideologias politicas como feminismo. Qual problema de voces? nao bastou She Hulk? o fracasso nao os fez perceber que o publico nao quer saber de causas machista ou feminista quando entra no cinema pra apenas ver seus herois em açao. O que adianta fazer o que os executivos querem, se no final é tudo para o publico, e se fazem o que o publico nao gosta, nao terao lucro, pois somos nós que pagamos o salario de todos voces.. E fazem questao de nos fazer odiar os filmes. nao iremos assistir, o que adianta? vao perder muito dinheiro enquanto nao entenderem pelo que voces fazem filmes.. é para nós, e nós rendemos o lucro que voces querem. so demonstram que estao cegos para a missao."

MCU SUCKS (kinda). I’m starting to think that white men as well as black men are being excluded from Marvel. For me the first bad MCU movie was definitely the Eternals, and then besides No Way Home everything beyond that was absolute garbage. MCU is now just a puppet of government “propaganda” and is just basically disgusting."

Why dont we like this? 
Im truly curious as to what people have to say 
Bcuz if anyones watched ""young avengers"" then they shouldknow nothing will ever b the same. N it took 10yrs to build up to endgame hype, so what is to be expected of these early phase movies?

Like i dont understand why everyomes roasting this trailer wirh memes. Remeber this is partionally the pandemics fault in the cause of quality so at least marvel tried to stay on track. Good thing they realized the community response n are pushing back phase 6 for quality assurances"

Спасибо крысиному Дриснею, портит то, что когда-то нравилось людям, хотя именно этот конкретный экземпляр особенный, мне даже первая часть не нравилась, вторую даже смотреть нет желания, будет только хуже, как и с каждым фильмом Марвел.
Вся надежда на то, что DC когда-нибудь всё же составит конкуренцию, пока Марвел всё больше расслабляется и забивает на тех, кто должен ходить на фильмы.
Фемки до мозга костей, разноцветные и прочие отклонения - они не ходят смотрят эти фильмы, но нет, нужно делать именно для них фильмы, так ещё и сюжет раньше хоть немного интересный мог быть, сейчас сразу понятно - смысла ноль, лишь бы шуток побольше и жопой трясти, как баба-халк."

The essence to me will have too much estrogen and femininity in the story and chemistry.

It'll bomb though if there's any politics and subliminal messages of females in power.

As a moviegoer it better stick to the script,  honor and follow the Marvel material.  Brie Larson is good but they need for her to keep the grit of the character from the previous films.  If they catered to a specific audience and not the Marvel fans, I won't be surprised if this tanks."

By the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men
Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will
Shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness
For he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children
And I will strike down upon thee
With great vengeance and furious anger
Those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers
And you will know my name is the Lord
When I lay my vengeance upon thee”"
