Captain Marvel, dressed in her red, blue, and gold suit, can be seen standing next to Bo and Luke Duke, clad in their signature denim and plaid ensembles. They're all sharing a laugh with Captain Kirk, who's wearing his classic blue tunic and gold command insignia. In the background, the Enterprise's warp engines glow ominously as the ship hovers over a desert landscape, complete with cacti and tumbleweeds. The characters seem to be enjoying themselves on this unexpected intergalactic adventure, with Captain Marvel's lightning bolt logo and the Dukes' iconic General Lee muscle car parked nearby. They went Marveling all over the place."

It was too short lol and i feel the most lacking part (not bad)  was the writing the actors knocked it out of the park and i really hope brie does more captain marvel she's the bomb! Loved kamala and monica too killer post credits music fight scenes etc effects a weebit clunky but that's ok if it leads to more greatness to come

         This trend of modern feminists imbuing every show/movie with misandry has become a problem for us fantasy/sci- fans. And what makes it so much worse is that if we comment about it we're called misogynists. This needs to stop.
         It's also so extremely hypocritical and devious of them.  They have become the very thing they hated in men, and are creating more inequality problems then helping.
     Being a published author, Hollywood needs to stop lazily shoving their political crap into their productions, because it breaks all emersion.  Also, good writers with skill and care can put a parable that's uplifting for the world into a story without it being so obvious and lame."

129,Sungpil Moon,2023-11-13T01:15:27Z,2023-11-13T01:15:27Z,2,"Prepare yourself for the abomination that is ""The Marvels,"" a movie so mind numbingly terrible that it makes you question the very existence of superhero films. From start to finish, this cinematic disaster delivers an unparalleled level of mediocrity that will leave you longing for the days when watching paint dry was considered entertainment. Let's begin with the plot—or lack thereof. ""The Marvels"" attempts to string together a series of incoherent scenes, hoping that flashy special effects and CGI will distract audiences from the fact that the storyline is as thin as a spider's web. The narrative is so disjointed that it feels like the result of a blindfolded toddler playing with a Marvel-themed coloring book. The characters, or caricatures rather, are a collection of one-dimensional cardboard cutouts that make you pine for the complexity of a Saturday morning cartoon. The actors seem to have phoned in their performances, delivering lines with the enthusiasm of someone reading a grocery list. It's almost as if they knew they were part of a cinematic train wreck and decided to detach themselves emotionally. Special effects? Oh, they spared no expense on the CGI spectacle. Unfortunately, it's like putting lipstick on a pig. The overuse of computer-generated imagery creates a visual assault that leaves you with a throbbing headache. The action sequences are so over-the-top and chaotic that it becomes impossible to discern who's fighting whom, leading to a perplexing mess on screen. Let's not forget the dialogue, which is an uninspired collection of clichés and cringe-worthy attempts at humor. The scriptwriters must have raided the bargain bin at a discount joke emporium, resulting in punchlines that land with all the grace of a lead balloon. If eye-rolling were an Olympic sport, ""The Marvels"" would take home the gold. In the end, ""The marvels"" is a cinematic travesty that will leave even the most die-hard Marvel fans questioning their allegiance. It's a disgrace to the superhero genre, a stain on the illustrious Marvel legacy, and a prime example of how hubris can lead to the creation of a film that should never have seen the light of day. Save your time, save your money, and spare yourself the agony of enduring this abysmal excuse for a movie. 0 out of 0. Fk you and give me my money back."

The movie was progressively getting worse while watching it. No problem to make a movie about only women being heroes, but this movie was targeted solely to teenage girls. Since infinity war I feel like marvel just decided to let chatGPT write the script, it is so corny with zero story. Even the music was terrible, the fast switching of scenery reminded me of watching reels. It’s time we boycott Marvel until they provide us with decent non-animated movies again. 

Score: 1/10"

1) Her greatness Captain Imbalance, the main universal warrior with white male chauvinistics.

2) Her fan is Pakistani teenage superhero Kamala Khan (Captain Pakistan), who dreams of being like her idol in everything.

3) A strong and independent black woman, Monica Rambeau, who is twice as strong cause she is black. 

One look from these three will make every toxic masculine oppressor want to hide in another universe"

Definitely not worst MCU movie (Eternals and Thor Love and Thunder), but very solid.

Fight scenes were excellent. Entanglement power up also amazing and unique. And broader MCU building is excellent -- especially in relation to the (otherwise terrible) Loki season 2 finale, and the two Into The Spider-Verse films so far.

This movie shows the MCU future is brighter than the recent garbage they've released. The Kamala Khan character is played very well"

433,54hman,2023-11-11T18:20:27Z,2023-11-11T18:20:27Z,0,So i just heard about this movie and its quite simple to understand how its sucking so much at the box office. Becasue nobody jewrd about it. Inhave about 5 coworkers who are diehard marvel fans and watch every movie that comes out and only one of them knew about this kovie before it released. Like never saw a single ad on youtube or tv and i usually see about 30-50 for every movie they release. Also using OG superheroes to promote this is pathetic. Reslly sjould have just stopped at endgame or hey maybe mot kick out the actors that made you billions

Kill all three of the main characters and let the villain win, otherwise this is literally the same exact movie that’s been made 30 prior times where all of the main characters barely get hurt and defeat the villain. Then there’s a secret cut scene post credits. Repeat. It seriously is already spoiled just by existing. Nobody needs to see this. We already know the ending."

Th3Birdman-One thing I've noticed since being on the internet for as long as I have: people expect (or in some cases PREFER) content creators that are black and white. 

That is to say, they are looking for someone that makes easily digestible arguments that eschew nuance and have no gradient to them. This is why certain creators that make political arguments when talking about media are SO popular. Cheap and easy political positions = views. 

Unfortunately, you won't get that from me. This in turn has led to people categorizing my work in a certain way, and asking questions like these (which I don't mind. I'm all for clarifying my stances, if necessary). People think positions like these are ""contradictory"", because they're so used to content creators holding firm on one position, which has the unfortunate result of painting that creator into a corner that they HAVE to defend out of pride. That creator then has to say ""this is a bad thing because of X"" or they believe they will lose their viewership.

These content creators do their audience a disservice in my opinion. The best way to critique media is on a case by case basis, free of previous biases. This is the only way an audience can get true a grasp on the content outside of seeing it for themselves.
""I get it, you don't like incels. I get it, you don't like feminism. Can we talk about the show, though?"""

1104,Luigi Nastro,2023-11-09T21:57:36Z,2023-11-09T21:58:12Z,0,"They're just straight up doing clickbait at this point. 
This trailer implies the villain has something to do with Thanos; she doesn't. The tone seems to be epic, implying there's an event that will change the outline of the MCU as whole; it doesn't. It's a goofy, basically inconsequential movie that essentially serves to set up the Young Avengers and maybe, just maybe the X-Men in the MCU. I wouldn't count on that, though. Remember Xavier in Doctor Strange 2? It's more of a set up for a sequel to this movie, than a teaser for the inevitable introduction of the X-Men. Deadpool 3 is coming out next year, after all. 
So, yeah, this is equivalent to clickbaiting."

Each one, marvelously unique. Within ours alone, we've endured the passing of several stars. Stars, of which, illuminated concepts of hope, motivation, teamwork, and strength. We move on, they moved on. Again, within ours alone...











     ********* But, in this universe: *********

A peculiar gathering... 6 silhouettes of translucent-onyx entities, appearing humanoid, and dressed in sparkly-striped sapphire robes, hence their translucent aspect. Facials: unanalyzed, only abysmal face pockets. 

Forming a hexagram, you notice nearly each individual wields something of curious magnificence...



A large sword, illuminated by a translucent, blazing, blue-topaz aura from the forth to its tip. 

A wooden staff, roughly half the length of the sword, similar width. One end, a sharp tip. Other end, a bulging handle. Shaft, in the form of a transverse wave. A peridot-green, blazing energy nearly covering the handle.

A wand... Its shaft: straight, with diamond shapes carved in; two rows, a pattern. Tips: shperical piece, one on each side. Each carry a pair of two demon-like horns on their sides. A face on each end: two eyes, one closed, and sad mouth. All together, orfices emit a dim amber light. 

No item, just hands. Orange hands. Sharp and long, white claws, emitting a warped, yet visibly-transparent force. 

Another staff, narrow, obsidian shade, hint of gold marks around itself. Gold annulus-circle on its top, along with a smaller, more dense circle as its resting piece. The annulus channels a blue-white, electrifying energy within and within it alone. 

Lastly, a book. Cover is covered by a crusty-gray object that almost fits in like a glove. Sand-pages, however, constantly turning, shimmering pink'n'navy-blue spots emtting and fading from the pages.






The given energies feed the hex... They fuse and convert to an ominously-dim scarlet color---spreading its power throughout all angles within the shape. A brief moment of suspense... A heavy burst of energy---its final color---emits above at rapid speed. No time to measure velocity... the commotion ultimately dies down. The energy eventually returns within the hexagram, and the scoured, fused power stays put for a moment... and fades away. 








What was the objective? Who answers? How far did we cross our place? What the hell have they done?"

You know their latest villain is mediocre-fiya if they can only illustrate them by calling back Thanos (e.g. same marketing campaign utilized for _AM3: Quantumania_ à la THANOS ≠ KANG).

This movie will fail, and Marvel will soon brand critics (and fans) sexist-racists again -- almost certainly by Sunday night/Monday a.m., after first weekend's box office are tallied. Bravo Feige."

They know what sells and what doesn't but consistently make movies nobody wants to watch.  I'm enjoying their downfall personally although it's costing us all some of our favourite IP's.

3 Captin MArvel had no depth at all

4 The villian was stupid and garbage..

I just watched the movie.
Its has lots of silly jokes. That didn't give the punch to be honest.
Felt live I've seen this movie before.
Also that musical part was a lot cringy than the jokes. 
And the post credit scene is about young avangers and yeah X-Men. Probably that's the only part is I wanted to actually see in the movie.

So, guys just pretend you are excited to avoid them to start a new ""universe"". Based on historic cinema movies and then crippled and distorted and dumbed up and adorned with THE MESSAGE.
Here a few nightmare scenarios:

1. Ben Hur universe - Only this time Ben Hur is a ""strong female character"" of the size of a midget. And when her chariot breaks down she just finishes the race on foot. But all that will be after 10 other boring franchise movies, prequels and sequels and parallel universe spin offs.... And hey - one could argue its even better because midget women weigh less and should have thus an edge in horse with wagon races.... But they will find a way to mess that one up, too....

2. The Waltons in space. Surefire no brainer that one - enuff said.

3. Dallas vs Dynasty - what could possibly go wrong?"

1549,KOR GAMING,2023-11-09T06:33:48Z,2023-11-09T06:33:48Z,0,Honestly They could have used SECRET INVASION as a Whole phase. Literally The Avengers Earth Mightiest Heroes animated series Had a Better Portrayal of Captain Marvel and The Secret Invasion Combined. Literally the cartoon had the whole Season 2 Dedicated to Secret Invasion And it’s a Cartoon. That would have been great to develop more of the Cosmic side of Marvel. Including having Nova/ Nova Corps. Do a Proper Kree/Skrull War film. This is just flat out Embrassing and honestly shows the lack of creative direction for these films now. 😢

I will always love Marvel till the day I die. They have helped inspire me to who I want to become. Now that I’m older and grew with 2 older sisters and within a 2 parent household. I become to understand women and their empowerment. However… this is NOT it. As Marvel fans across all race/ genders. We can’t accept someone who so easily popped up in Endgame.  Who ALWAYS claims to be the strongest without acknowledging a single AVENGER that fought before her. She needs to be HUMBLED and or replaced by SPECTRUM.

Because that's not any of the marvels and you can tell by the face and the outfit. I can't construe that as anything else because she's literally falling apart. Why would you strip your villain of all threat by showing their defeat in the Trailer before the movie even releases? Someone better get fired for that and for gods sake get your Crap together MCU.

I sorta understand the sides but at the same time I think it’s unfair to criticize a movie based on high standards set by the previous amazing movies that they’ve released in the past. There will be good ones, there will be bad ones but no movie deserves this much hate. Think of all the people working on it just for the community to react like this. It hasn’t even released yet, at least wait to actually watch the movie before you fully call it out for bullshit"

The latter being owned by Sony for no reason as she isnt even related to Spider Man in anyway.. She was daughter of an Agent of Hydra which is MCU.. Carol is from the 90s so her friends would be really old today doh so no JJ connection. Reviews are positive anyhow go see it.

All these hate comments are from those who only expect every single film to be like an infinity wars/ endgame level. In reality it was year to get to that level and that’s what all these films are leading to. I remember there were many other films leading to Infinity War and End Game that were horrible but still added to the MCU. Y’all need to stop and just continue to support the MCU

And perhaps also find other younger people that need nurturing? Having read this back it almost sounds like this idea would tie into an X-Men introduction.

They KNOW they've got a stinker here and that they've actively run the MCU into the ground these last 2 phases. Remember when Brie Larson/Captain Marvel was going to be the face of the MCU from Phase 4 onward.....yeh, how did that go again?! :P Hmm, maybe reminding people that the MCU USED to be good, emphasis on the words USED TO, isn't the best idea to convince your audience that your current MCU isn't a steaming pile of hot garbage! This is the same company that was planning to make Blade a 4th lead in his own movie (after 5 attempted script rewrites), so that the focus could be on his daughter and 'life lessons' (because life lessons in a vampire movie makes total sense) and is also planning to make the Fantastic Four focused predominantly on Sue Storm, with the main storyline focusing on the ""toxic masculinity"" of Mr. Fantastic. Coz yeh, that's exactly what we all wanted from a Fantastic Four film. Remember though, there's NO agenda here! Hmmm. Who's really buying that anymore? Calling it now, the focus in Deadpool 3 will shift from Deadpool and Wolverine (the interaction that anyone going to see the movie is most interested to see) to focus predominantly on Elektra (a character no one cares about. Specifically a version of that character that failed TWICE already on the big screen). Each scene of Elektra is one less scene with Ryan Reynolds'' Deadpool or Hugh Jackman's Wolverine. Can you honestly tell me that's what you're paying for when you buy a ticket for Deadpool 3? :("

I get that it was a super boring trailer which Disney is trying to nostalgia bait people with characters that aren't even in this movie. So I could understand that it may have been overlooked.

But ""Black girl magic"" has to be the funniest thing Marvel has ever produced. What does that even mean? Why would that motivate someone who can fly to save some from falling? You'd think the person falling would be like ""Oh shlt, that person is falling, I who is the only person here that can fly must save them!""

No we get hesitation and the line ""black girl magic"" as the motivating line.😂😂😂"

This looks like someone took 6 Marvel movies and tried to make a patch work quilt out of them. Disney basically said so in the first 5 seconds when they tried to put a montage of the fan favorites. Then they did it again by trying to recreate the Thor Captain America hammer on shield scene. This is going to be the dumpster fire every knew it would be.

Cause Thanos was nothing by comparison!  😂😂  I expect the movie to be another silly female power disney crap. But it seems like it has some solid action scenes, hopefully with good sound.

But jokes aside,  I agree, Marvel needs to make some effort to rekindle the flame. A complete reboot would be the best option, with new actors and a different take on the multiverse concept. Think about how long Marvel is been making these types of movies. I saw the first Ironman movie in the cinema, a diehard marvel fan but I have to admit that isn't as appealing anymore. I do want to see this movie, because unlike a lot of fans I liked the Brie Larson - Samuel L Jackson combo, I think they have a good on screen chemistry. At the same time I'm taking into account that this movie probably will not really surprise me anymore."

Many people may not like it but for me when i watch any movie i dont take notice of all the hate that people say i watch movies for escape, i in my eyes these movies are chapters in a wounderful story that takes me to a different world. People may like it people may hate it yet for me it was a wounder chapter in a story. I make up my own mind. Not let others tell me what i should or should not watch."

Hyping up this movie like it's a sequel to Endgame. A gender-swapped Kree and an ethnically diverse super-powered Charlie's Angels doesn't make it a worthy successor to Endgame. If you want to push your female empowerment message, try letting the women be women, instead of gender-swapped men. A female character doesn't need to be an emotionless robot or act like a man to be strong."

2684,Quixotic Quotient,2023-11-08T03:45:03Z,2023-11-08T03:45:03Z,0,"Reminds me of the Avengers: Infinity War trailer where you saw Cap, Bucky, Widow, Black Panther, Okoe and the HULK charging. In the actual film it was Banner in the Hulk Buster armor. So NO epic battle between Hulk and Thanos. Is this the same? Show clips of Tony Stark and Steve Rogers in the time travel suits then a quick clip(at 1:44) of somebody walking by in a time travel suit as Monica Rambeau looks on. Is it just a marketing scheme to get people to see the movie in theaters hoping that it's Iron Man or Captain America? You know, the two most favorite characters that Marvel KILLED OFF!!! But in reality it was just a cgi trick or someone like Antman showing up. (Love you Paul Rudd but still sad Iron Man was killed off and Cap. America left his still brain washed Bucky after he tore the Avengers apart) Final thought, if it's a trick, I WILL find out who came up with this idea, WHO approved this idea for the trailer and when I find them whisper one name in their ears..............ANNIE WILKES."

Just so cringy for a superhero franchise and it breaks down the 4th wall.
Been noticing way too much of this stuff in MCU lately.
It’s almost like they know people are getting fed up with the wokeness and they are just rubbing it in at this point and seem to not care about ticket sales. It’s their prerogative cus it’s their movies, but I for one will not be attending any more Marvel films 🤷🏻‍♂️"

not sure how well this is going to do. Due to a wide array of factors currently working against this movie. 
But I would say, this was a lot more interesting and showed the stakes more.

...yeah, that was a little too nostalgia-baity at the start harking back to Endgame with Iron-Man and Captain America. Pretty sure they won't be in this aside from MAYBE some reused footage. But rest of the trailer seemed a little more interesting. Silly can be good and fun. But it always helps to know the stakes and why we should care and like this."

Post endgame for mcu is truly a disaster…for every rare glimpse of the mcu we love (spidey no way home), there are multiples of trash…..antman….secret invasion(completely ruined one of the greatest comic series, and the way they killed off Mariah Hill after a decade+ in mcu is a crime)……Thor love thunder - an amazing cast and potentially epic movie turned into a bad comedy - completely destroyed by the clown director…shehulk…etc..

With the exception of maybe yelena, there is not a single interesting new hero that was introduced…all boring cookie cutter characters that lack any emotional connection with the fans…

They should just stopped the mcu after endgame, released Spider-Man no way home as a one off to dangle the multiverse concept. Then reset the whole thing and went on to create X-men / f4 as a new universe…..then maybe after 10 years once it’s mature enough…reintroduced the original mcu and link it back into 1 using multiverse…"

2994,Josh George,2023-11-07T22:49:04Z,2023-11-07T22:49:04Z,184,"This is a super interesting marketing pivot. Just a couple weeks ago there was an interview with the director where she said this movie was gonna be a silly goofy wacky time, and the first couple of trailers really played up the lightness of the tone. Then they drop this a few days before release and it's a totally different tone and direction. Now it's a continuation of the Endgame story and they try to lure people with those opening shots of Iron Man and Cap. You can smell it in the air; they know this one's about to bomb and they're scrambling trying to do damage control.

I think this movie will be pretty forgettable, but it's going to give a fascinating insight into the MCU's problems. Can't wait for it to come out, but for none of the reasons Marvel intended."

Wanna see silver surfer... galactus.. dr doom. Beta ray bill epic choreographwd fights fast paced momenyum. The fights in the trailer look terrible.  When will someone with comic nerd love get control again this activism bs is annoying.

ps this shouldnt have been a trailer this should have never been a trailer i dont even think it can be classed as a trailer it spoils the entire movie and the first 30 seconds are clips or audio from films unrelated to the characters in the movie

1- the villians motives arent clear the reason they said shes continuing thanos' mission is so people think shes a threat on thanos' level and from what i can tell from the trailer thats not what shes trying to do you can see in the final fight she is on her ship next to the portal which i believe is the other universe what it seems like shes actually doing is invading planets and conquering them for the kree and then shes going to try and take over the other universe. nothing like thanos his motive was set in trying to save people not enhance his race.

2- the costume is a problem marvel has a problem with over design reliance on cgi/ nano tech helmets and dark colours how are you going to tell her apart from all the other characters that have similar dark and not iconic costumes especially when she doesnt seem to have any personality except ""oh i am bad ahhh"" 

3- the budget has been terrible it was reported that they spent $274.8 million but a company like disney will rarely be honest about how much they spend . plus the fact that doesnt count marketing wich has to be high because i don not see any other reason there would be so many articles posted about how important marvels is.

4- the trailers have been terrible. they have tried to bait people into watching by baiting with thor ironman cap and thanos and the ending is said to have over characters but i wont spoil them here whilst alienating a majority of there audience. like in the first trailer were they litterally make fun of how they havent listened to any fan complaints eg when they chose a song just because it said ""dont you tell me to smile""

honestly i could go on for longer but i just hope that marvel and disney can get it through there extremely thick skull that they cant keep ignoring there audience."

3198,Robert Anderson,2023-11-07T19:48:47Z,2023-11-07T19:49:45Z,0,"I feel sorry for Brie Larson.  First she won an Academy Award and was poised to be the next Meryl Streep.  Then when that didn't happen she looked to replace Robert Downey, Jr. as the leader of the Avengers for the next decade and earn the money and popularity to choose projects in order to make herself the next Meryl Streep.  But sadly that's not going to happen either.  She went from being Queen Brie, the ruler of Diversityland, to not being diverse enough to be the star of her own sequel.  I suspect in a few years people will say, ""Brie Larson?  Oh she was great in _The Room._  I wonder why her and Tommy Wiseau didn't make a sequel?"""

The first trailer emphasized the silly humor (and bad CGI), and it underwhelmed fans; so they released another trailer that was better received. That one made it seem more like something MCU fans might expect- less goofy, and with She Hulk interacting more with other superheroes. It turned out the first one was the accurate one. Now we have The Marvels, with an enormous change in tone between the trailers, one silly and one serious. Which one is like the movie? I'll point out the tone in this new one relies heavily on scenes from other movies."

A lot of directors stay away from Marvel because of all the oversight in post. Marvel overseas all MCU titles after they're made to make sure everything ties together, and directors are left without much say in what the final product looks like. The mess people are talking about with DaCosta is likely a common occurrence with directors but because so many Marvelheads are ready to see a women-led film fail, the Black woman behind the film is being blamed."

They need to talk to Kamala’s family and the Jin’s to know how kill her. I hope X-men come thru incursion to help them.

The first couple trailers looked goofy and dumb but this one is interesting and makes me want to see the movie. Marvel should fire their marketing department.

Whoever this is - is probably from another dimension OR that final boss is much more powerful than they say. Something isn't right here. ""They win with the power of friendship"" again. Kamala has the staff & she has her bracers I would guess. Making that weapon hers now or at least useable. 

From the leaks no surprise villains show, so this is just an over CGId scene."

It's weird, but hey, it's the same story, but a different century.  They'll come at anything that has to do with women in the comics, yet they say they read comics, (oh but just the ""strong, muscular, white men""). And the fact that the dudebros stopped at nothing to ruin Brie Larson's career, just because she wasn't a a people pleaser, she's real, and that's something I really admire from her. The Captain Marvel fans are thrilled for this film to come, especially with these two new additions to the MCU. It's okay that you don't like them, but attacking and sending death threats to young girls and women for enjoying something you don't, you must so miserable and pathetic, I just saw a very inappropriate comment on a post in regards to this film, so yeah I'm not overreacting, I'm reacting like every dude, does but for some reason will women will be the one burned, like a witch."

There's been slim to none of a plot cumulation betwixt the shows or movies to warrant this hype tier on par with Infinity War or Endgame.

3419,GoincognitoUareprobablyshadowbanned,2023-11-07T17:30:20Z,2023-11-07T17:30:20Z,1,Nick Fury has been nerfed to the point where he can't even aim a laser gun in one of the trailers. Disney's WRITERS need to be fired for having a cat take his eye and having him say Black girl magic like some weird blogger. I'm surprised they didn't have him say hashtag black girl magic while making a heart shape with his hands at this point. Fury deserved his own movie at one point now they just gender role swapped him like the HIGH majority of characters at Disney.

3448,Michael Cin,2023-11-07T17:14:03Z,2023-11-07T18:42:02Z,10,"This, or something similar, should have been released way earlier in the marketing cycle. 

We finally understand how this relates to the multiverse saga and we understand how the villain could possibly be a serious threat to Carol. The only problem is the movie comes out in a few days and until now the majority of the earlier trailer material has made it look like it was just the most expensive buddy comedy of all time between Carol and 2 characters that probably 90% of people cannot identify as they struggle with teleporting power glitches against a woman who has a genie bracelet and is super pissed at Carol for some reason.  

Like it’s just mind boggling that they waited until now to reveal to casual audiences that the film might actually matter to the so called multiverse saga.  But I also see where they might have thought there was multiverse burnout so might be best to not lead with that, but it should not have taken this long to realize that the buddy comedy angle was not going to sell enough tickets—should have gone all hands on deck weeks ago to convince casuals that the movie is action packed and matters.  

One of my bigger wishes though is that the multiverse saga would have focused on one or two ways tops in which the multiverse was at risk of breaking and guide the phases toward that inevitable break so it would be shocking.  Now we’ve had near multiversal destruction from Spider man + Dr. Strange, Wanda + Dr. Strange, a Dr. Strange variant, another Dr. Strange variant, an Ultron variant, Loki, A Kang variant (who tried to escape the quantum realm to destroy the multiverse though we never saw the fabric of reality start to actually destabilize), and now Dar Ben + Carol.  

Also, recycling the beginning part felt like nostalgia bait.  A little tacky, but I understand this movie needs every last minute trick in the book to get more ticket sales.   

I’m still going to see this movie in theaters to support it, but it’s just hard not to acknowledge how poorly the marketing was handled for this project."

3513,King CXbra,2023-11-07T16:45:55Z,2023-11-07T16:45:55Z,1,I enjoyed Ms Marvel and honestly thought the kiddo gave it her all. And now she leveled up heavily. Monica had a weird entrance in Wandavision but that’s just due to it being a weird production in general. But hopefully they have the actress more room to breathe and let her talent shine (no pun intended). For Captain Marvel on the other hand I really do hope Bri’s antics were worth it. Not only being rude and hard to work with in production but a few delays were due to her alone. I’m just hoping it’s not a let down. Bc if it is then honesty it gives no wiggle room for the bs some of them had to put up with.

When they do a recap of all the successful characters/movies they did to try and say 'hey remember these guys?! come see this movie because we just showed you them again in the trailer!'

Strange off doing his thing for causing an incursion, Kang's variants in the wings, Shang-Chi's rings and whatever those mid and post credit scenes were about in Eternals. Maybe pieces will come together in this movie, maybe not but 2025 isn't too far away with Secret Wars."

3957,tha illYankee,2023-11-07T14:30:55Z,2023-11-07T14:30:55Z,1,"So afraid for this film 😱 It seems to be advertised with the same flaws used for Quantumania: The marketing & plot was so concerned about promoting Kang at the expense of the chemistry & nuances between the protagonists that made the previous Ant-Man films successful.

The Marvels movie is in worse shape than that: There's no proven chemistry between the 3 protagonists and the audience is being asked to believe it will be entertaining to watch them defeat the next big threat...throwing Thanos' Legacy into the mix in an attempt to bolster the story's legitimacy.

As a Marvel Head, I have my  ticket to see The Marvels for this Thursday night and I, especially after Secret Invasion, am not convinced nor more motivated to see what happens.

This movie SORELY needed the SAG-AFTRA Strike to be over so the Public could witness, for free via interviews, that Brie, Teyonah & Iman get along 😑"

No, a strong guest of wind could topple her, had they portrayed her as a cunning villain who works in the shadows instead of a twig carrying a big stick, sure  .  One would think disney would have learned this with kylo... 

side note:
I don't need to tell a washed up, mid 30s white actor who peaked long ago what didn't work in her movie, this commit isn't made for you.  Many will go after this movie because its female driven, that's stupid. Girls need role models too. But putting bad actors in, hurt the cause, Iman could and will likely steal the show as she's the only one that comes across as excited to be there. I truly hope she does well in her career and doesn't lose her joy of acting."
