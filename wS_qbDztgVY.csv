Marvel has lost their touch, Disney destroyed Marvel Studios all the way to the Disney song/dance segment.  Embarrassing.  Thanks Marvel & Disney  for saving us MUCH money & time in future film/TV viewing.  Marvel Studios, you'll never get back to how great you were (and CARED) before Disney grabbed you.  Such a shame."

The Marvels is truly a marvel of nonsense and stupidity. If you enjoyed this movie it only shows that you were so taken by the little kittens and the bollywood charade that you failed to notice your IQ dropping during this disaster of a movie. But hey, this is what happens when you put all your money into special effects and you are left  with very little to pay good writers.  Well good night everyone, I'm gonna watch an episode of Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey and pray that Neil deGrasse Tyson can help me recover the neurons I lost while watching The Marvels... Out."

Tax money is wasted, talent is taken, and resources are drained from talented artists who could tell better stories! Disney clearly doesn't care about us fans.  All this wastefulness would make the Disney founder ashamed."

So y’all can guess which culture over thrown all of them. Now I’m not racist. But if white American actors/characters from Disney classics, comic books or marvel verse are being replaced with African Americans. Then it’s only fair to say for the Latino/Mexican culture get a shot too. We have the same qualifications as everyone else does. Hollywood just needs to open more opportunities. There’s been Asian people who have become legends in Hollywood. But no Mexicans. We don’t all look like George Lopez or Luis Guzman or Michael Peña. Hollywood if y’all want more viewers to hit ur screens, then I suggest give others a chance to shine as well or else y’all r gonna get nothing but continuous negative feedback on movies.

Very hard sell and just not fun to watch. Imagine Princess Bride without the romance or comedy.  Eek.  I see silly behavior which does not equate with funny. Leads to point 3. Characters here are too cartoony and silly, if they can't take this movie and it's premise seriously (universe under threat) why should I? The X-men had moments of levity but they weren't cartoonish and making a mockery of the very film/world their in.  4. The main villain is weak.  A hero is only as good as his/her villain. You're not going to see James Bond matched up against a 12 year old paper boy.  That would be a short and silly fight.  I hear the main villain talking big but I'm not believing it. She's just way too pretty/perfect to take seriously.  Perfect people aren't angry/threatening, they are boring."

1 the black girl magic line -corny af and it just make monica a ""black superhero"" instead of just a superhero who just happens to be black which for me i have issue with

2 Monica essential ""dies"" /trapped in another dimension and for me itz like great they get rid if the only black[DARK SKIN] superhero and the fact that she really didnt add anything to the story except for the end basically just the token black character yet again

3 Captin MArvel had no depth at all

4 The villian was stupid and garbage..

""Love how happy Kamala is when she say they are a team... Love her 😍""

""I love how Carol went just 😮 while Kamala is freaking out over Goose and Monica just gave up""

""This looks like a lot of fun, honestly! I'm very excited to see this movie in theaters, and I love the fact that the unlikely trio of Captain Marvel, Monica Rambeau, and Kamala Khan aka Ms. Marvel are going to be teaming up to save the universe. Looking forward to seeing Nick Fury again, Goose, and the Khan family!""

Wooo y recontra wooo. No solo espero que se convierta, esta joya, esta pelicula dulce (pelicula de miel), en una obra de culto... Estoy seguro que será como una religión un caso de estudio. La peli que impondrá records en taquilla, en la villa, en la silla,maravilla,sos ladilla. Estoy seguro que todas las expectativas - y más - que tienen de esta miel de peli se les van a cumplir.

But then, that's social media.. Not a place for the smart.  I have to assume this movie was made because Disney / Marvel determined there is enough demand for it to be profitable.  So good for them.  The infinity saga will go down as priceless memories for me, and ""no way home"" is also right up there.  I am not a  Captain Marvel fan.. Black Widow, Gamora, and Mantis are more my speed.  I do like Kamala and her family though, but not sure it will get me into the theatre.  Captain Marvel suffers from the ""Superman problem"" in that there's just not much as stake.

Monica Rambeaux is the official Apologist for Scarlett Witch's mind-rape of thousands of people.

Kamala Khan is the type of character that is typically the villain:  Whines ""why can't I have superpowers?"" and then gets them.

Carol Danvers is as intriguing as dried Elmer's Glue.  I was initially excited to see this character on-screen back when Infinity War forecasted it, but she's just not FUN."

Disney has released simply AWFUL products for several years now and blamed everyone but themselves in horrible ways. They are awful people and deserve the failure they're experiencing now and will continue to experience. 

You, MCU/Brie lover who wants to dismiss me as a hater: watch the total box office for this be under 400m total and know that means it LOST ABOUT 150 MILLION DOLLARS for Disney (220m budget after their tax rebate, 110m marketing, 50% box office take = 660m break even points. Well below 400m Box office means below 200m earned on a 330m spend. 

Dismiss me if you want and stick your fingers in your ears but enjoy this because Disney are DONE they can't keep losing money like this and the reason it has died is simple: a mix of TERRIBLE writing and DISGUSTING hatred spewed from disney to explain why their films flop - it's our fault not theirs. 

I personally feel sorry for Brie and the rest of the cast being made into hated people as puppets in Disney's excuse marketing machine. I don't think she deserves the hate because I think she was told to say and do everything by them.  She's a scapegoat. The real villains are the upper end of Disney and FINALLY they're paying the price and this is just the beginning (check their stock price if you don't believe me). Bye bye MCU, loved you phase 1-3, you ran 2008-2025/2026 then ended just WATCH"

MCU needs to bring R-rated movie and serious thriller action rather then wasting great characters like captain marvel and Gorr the God Butcher with garbage movie. I still can't believe this film pose to be a huge big budget movie. But why take far to long to bring part 2 with such a long waste. No 1 cares or has hype for this film.

But I, and I believe most other men, and even women are tired of this. I’m sick of seeing these movies that are clearly set up to break the gender role and make it blatantly obvious with the message they are trying to get across. I truly believe Disney and other film companies will never understand that them doing these types of films actually undermines the concept of gender equality because they’re making it as if this PARTICULAR film is the exception and not the status quo. It’s how they butchered She-Hulk and so many other female superhero characters. It’s really offensive to women in general when you think about it. I don’t wanna see *”Strong Female Characters.”* I wanna see *”Strong Characters who happen to be Female.”*"

I'll keep my money in my pocket and not watch this woke Girl Power movie.

The actresses will be empowered by not being subjected to my ""white male gaze"".

Marvel gets to blame the public when the movie loses $200 million.

This is what Hollywood considers to be effective marketing nowadays:  spitting poison at the public.

It's like radical Leftist politics have actually rotted their brain.   They have taken Leftist identity politics and made it into literally a cult religion.  

RADICAL LEFTISM NOW HAS ALL THE USUAL QUALITIES ASSOCIATED WITH CULT BEHAVIOR.

""Specific factors in cult beh aviour are said to include manip ulative and authoritarian mind control over members, communal and totalistic organization, aggressive proselytizing, systematic programs of indoctr ination, and perpetuation in middle-class communities.""

Can you think of ANY successful product EVER where the marketing consisted of spewing childish insults at the public?

Have you ever seen a Ford commercial where they say, ""If you don't buy a Ford truck, then you are the scumm of humanity"" ?

Good luck with that, Marvel.  Keep making these Girl Power movies and spitting poison when they flop!   It's so empowering to women when Marvel loses another $200 million!"

As long as Robert Dawney Jr. was in the MCU, all the films and shows of the MCU were super hits.  But ever since Robert Dawney Jr left the MCU, the MCU has been on a downward spiral.  Robert Dawney Jr. had just arrived to upgrade the MCU.  But MCU's fate.  And best wishes to 'The Marvels' and team.

2542,Jordan Verbeek,2023-10-21T11:30:14Z,2023-10-21T11:30:14Z,6,"I won't deny Guardians gave us the best and worst changes of the MCU.
Firstly, they introduced the cosmic side of the universe. Thor and Dr. Strange have both shown the good, bad and ugly side of this.
Secondly, goofy humour perpetrated the MCU and made it hard to bridge the gap between humourous scenes and dramatic scenes (see the airport scene from Civil War to see what I mean).

I'm interested to see the Marvels, but it'll only work if they balance out the two points I've found difficult with the MCU. It will be hard to convince me that the film will be a game changer, but it doesn't hurt if the Marvels turns out to be a great popcorn film like Thor: Ragnarok."

2) Light Points = (Energy / Massless    /  Does Change Size)

1) When 1 Dark Point and 1 Light Point combine, they create 1 Dipole Element.
2) When 2 Dipole Elements combine, they create 1 Photon.
3) When 1,823 Photons combine, they create 1 Proton. When 1,824 Photons combine, they create 1 Neutron
4) When Protons and Neutrons combine, they create the rest of existence

1) 1 Dark Point + 1 Light Point = 1 Dipole Element.
2) 2 Dipole Elements = 1 Photon.
3) 1,823 Photons = 1 Proton & 1,824 Photons = 1 Neutron.
4) Protons + Neutrons = Everything & Everything is Light

When enough Dark Points and Light Points combine, the Dark Points all congregate in the center of the protons and neutrons and the Light Points create a coating around the Dark Points so that they're no longer seen. In the stable elements, extra photons want to combine with the protons and neutrons, but are repelled into orbitals by the Light Points. 

Roger Spurr of Mudfossil University on YouTube has irrefutable proof of this and even convinced CERN to change out their particle detectors for CMOS detectors so they too can see this for themselves. Update: CERN has now detected what they call neutrinos (Dark Points & Light Points) for the first time ever, after having listened to Roger Spurr.

Venturis Create Free Energy:
Principle 1: Dark Points cannot change size
Principle 2: Light Points can change size
Principle 3: When (red or blue or green, etc) photons enter into a venturi the Dark Points will be forced to return from the direction that they came from, but the Light Points will separate from the Dark Points and condense and go through the throat of the venturi.
Principle 4: When Light Points pass through the throat of a venturi alone, they create what is known as electron showers and increase their energy 200x
Task 1: Send (red or blue or green, etc) photons into a Venturi which has a throat smaller than the size of Dark Points.
Task 2: Manufacture a device that can capture this excess energy in the pure energy zone and funnel some of it back to the light generating device and some of it toward a battery.
Note 1: You need CMOS detectors to see photons.

As the light gets pulled into the venturi the Light Points condense to go through the throat. The Dark Points on the other hand cannot change size and are forced backward, away from the throat. As the Points separate, called fission, excess energy is created by the Light Points. Immediately on the exit end of the venturi is a very small zone of pure massless energy of only Light Points. These Light Points will have a significantly increased energy level of 200x as compared to the energy that went into the venturi. Immediately beyond this very small zone of pure energy is when Dark Points show up to attach to the Light Points, which is fusion. We want to use the energy before the Dark Points begin attaching to the Light Points.

How to Create Infinite Excess Energy:
1) Create a venturi with a throat that is smaller than the diameter of Dark Points. 
2) Send (red or blue or green, etc) photons through the venturi. 
3) If an absorption and siphoning device can be placed in the zone of pure massless energy, before fusion occurs, we can harness free unlimited clean energy. Route some energy back to the light generator & route some energy to a battery or whatever device you want.

Repent of your sins or suffer the consequences. Lord Jesus died in our places personally to take the death punishment that sin deserves and then resurrected by the power of God. Believe this and sincerely repent of your sins each time you sin and you will have eternal life and nothing to fear. Fail to repent and you will end up in the Lake of Fire."

Love all his kdramas but on the IMdp his name is up on the movie but they don't list what his character name is. I think he is the only one without his character name listed. And in his IMDP the Marvel movie is not listed either. So that tells me one of two things either he is a supervised character or he dies like 5 min. into the movie. I mean if i go and watch this and he is killed off like 5 min  in I will be po lol Maybe I just wait for streaming. lol

3252,raremage,2023-10-13T04:42:31Z,2023-10-13T04:42:31Z,4,"I want to like this. I mean I love Marvel comics and Endgame was my childhood writ large on the big screen, it literally brought tears to my eyes.

But this feels so much like Marvel trying to force two characters who really haven’t had much comic success down my throat.  I mean, Ms Marvel has been rebooted again and again and again in the comics and just hasn’t cracked the fandom.  Captain Marvel is amazing but adding in Monica Rambeau is, again, a character of very limited success in the comic world, it just doesn’t excite me the way I wish it did.

Just about every movie leading up to Infinity War and then Endgame was better than the one before it.  Now it feels like they’re cranking out movies to keep things busy while all the fans are waiting hungrily for the X-Men and Fantastic Four to start rolling.  

I’d love to be wrong but I bet I’m not."

A lot of people want to see better movies with more mature themes with more intellectual stimulation.
""Joker"" did that.

Captain Marvel was NEVER vulnerable. 

They could have just done that, boom another billion dollar movie. 

This is a ridiculous excuse to give other people screen time. 

They did it because Brie was not likable at the start of her career and they fixed her. 

Why bother fixing her if you ruin her next movie with only 2 other good names in it:

Mckenna (handmaids tale) and Jackson."

3615,Saspider Soni,2023-10-06T13:49:39Z,2023-10-06T13:49:39Z,2,And also put limited comedy in Marvel movies. The extra comedy in thor4 gauradians3 has spoiled all our expectations
3616,Saspider Soni,2023-10-06T13:47:24Z,2023-10-06T13:47:24Z,1,"You know why Marvel is falling down because they do not realise which fans like or they want. Everybody expected that  atleast iromheart should be boy. It is turning into like Marvel is for girls. And everyone around hero is turning into a hero so what would be the respect for hero.
For example Spiderman is hero which everyone likes and related from children to older people but if everyone around him would turn into a hero so what would be his respect that is if Gwen turn into a hero or falsh turns into hero so.
Please atleast stop more girl heroes."

I love the MCU and enjoyed Ms marvel. Cap Marvel was kinda slow. It was ok altogether. But now they’ve released all trailers for the movie, they’ve basically spoiled the film. They get their powers detangled, defeat Dar-Benn and now Ms Marvel will have some connection to the multiverse."

For example make it public that you want a company to make A HIGH quality Vader series for example that you will not mess up. So Disney can focus on whatever weird agenda they want to push with the NEW stuff and let the FANS get what they want. Disney can even have a Netflix or Amazon make an animated version of the alternate REAL Luke Skywalker story. The FACT that these franchises are on life support is CRAZY. Make Mickey mouse, and animation relevant again. Why hasn't the animated movie version of World War Hulk not come out yet? Planet Hulk was out Years ago. FIX it."
